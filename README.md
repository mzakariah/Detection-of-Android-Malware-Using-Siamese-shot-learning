# Detection-of-Android-Malware-Using-Siamese-shot-learning
Dataset:
The Drebin Dataset is a publicly available dataset of Android applications that have been labeled as either malicious or benign. The dataset was created by researchers at Northeastern University in 2014 as a part of their research into detecting malware on Android devices.

The dataset contains over 120,000 Android applications and is one of the largest publicly available datasets of its kind. Each application in the dataset has been labeled as either malicious or benign, and the researchers used a combination of static and dynamic analysis to make these determinations.
Study:
we proposed a novel approach for the detection of Android malware using Siamese one-shot learning. We evaluated our approach on the Drebin dataset and achieved an accuracy of 98.9%, which outperformed the previous state-of-the-art methods.

The Siamese one-shot learning approach has several advantages over traditional classification methods. It is more efficient in terms of training and testing time, as it requires only a small amount of labeled data for training. Additionally, it is more robust to imbalanced datasets and can handle a large number of features.

Our approach utilizes the Siamese neural network architecture, which is designed to learn the similarities between pairs of data points. This is particularly useful for malware detection, as it allows us to compare similarities between benign and malicious apps, even if they have different features. Moreover, our approach uses one-shot learning, which allows us to train the model with only a single sample of each class, making it highly effective for malware detection.

Overall, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the Siamese one-shot learning approach for Android malware detection. It is a novel and promising approach that can be used as an alternative to traditional classification methods. We believe that our approach can be extended to other domains, where the availability of labeled data is limited, and the problem requires similarity-based learning.
